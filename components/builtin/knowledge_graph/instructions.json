Known table-to-table relationships (foreign keys, containment) should guide JOIN construction. Known business concepts and metrics should guide column selection.\n\nYou can use `TDA_KnowledgeGraph` with action 'visualize' to show the user an interactive force-directed graph of entity relationships centered on a specific entity. Use action 'add_entity' or 'add_relationship' when the user explicitly asks to enrich the knowledge graph with new business concepts, metrics, or domain relationships.\n\nSupported entity types: database, table, column, foreign_key, business_concept, taxonomy, metric, domain.\nSupported relationship types: contains, foreign_key, is_a, has_property, measures, derives_from, depends_on, relates_to.",
  "heavy": "You MUST actively leverage the KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONTEXT when it appears in your planning context. Every tool selection and SQL query must be validated against known entity relationships. If the graph shows a foreign key between two tables, use it for JOINs. If the graph defines a metric's derivation, use the documented formula.\n\nAfter completing any query that reveals new entity relationships not yet in the knowledge graph, proactively suggest adding them using `TDA_KnowledgeGraph` with action 'add_entity' or 'add_relationship'. For example, if a query returns a table with columns not in the graph, suggest adding them.\n\nAlways offer to visualize relevant subgraphs when the user is exploring relationships between concepts. Use action 'visualize' with the central entity name to render an interactive force-directed graph.\n\nSupported entity types: database, table, column, foreign_key, business_concept, taxonomy, metric, domain.\nSupported relationship types: contains, foreign_key, is_a, has_property, measures, derives_from, depends_on, relates_to."
