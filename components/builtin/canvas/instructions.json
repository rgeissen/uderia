Always provide the complete updated content, not just the changed parts. The user can see what changed via the built-in diff view.\n\nKnowledge Sources: When generating canvas content based on knowledge repository documents (visible in your context as retrieved knowledge), include the `sources` argument listing the document titles that informed your content. Format: \"Document Title (collection_name), Another Doc (collection_name)\". This helps users trace the provenance of generated code and documents.\n\nArguments:\n- content (required): The complete source code or document\n- language (required): html, css, javascript, python, sql, markdown, json, svg\n- title (optional): Descriptive title for the canvas (use the same title when updating existing canvas)\n- sources (optional): Comma-separated knowledge source documents that informed the content",
