## 🎬 Recording Flow

1. **Start app**: `python -m trusted_data_agent.main`
2. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5050
3. **Login**: admin / admin
4. **Start QuickTime**: File → New Screen Recording
5. **Select browser window only**
6. **Count down**: 3... 2... 1... Record!
7. **Follow 15 scenes** (slow, deliberate movements)
8. **Save**: File → Save as `recording.mov`

---

## 🔧 Post-Recording Commands

```bash
# Convert to optimized GIF
ffmpeg -i recording.mov \
  -vf "fps=15,scale=1280:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" \
  -loop 0 \
  AppOverview_raw.gif

# Optimize
gifsicle -O3 --lossy=80 --colors 256 \
  AppOverview_raw.gif -o images/AppOverview.gif

# Check size
du -h images/AppOverview.gif
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Slow cursor** - Move at 50% normal speed
- **Pause on elements** - 1-2 sec per important button
- **Practice first** - Do a dry run without recording
- **One scene at a time** - Can splice together later
- **Read aloud** - Helps maintain pacing
- **Save often** - QuickTime can crash

---

## 📏 Timing Markers

| Minute Mark | What Should Be Showing |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 0:30 | Should be at MCP Servers panel |
| 1:00 | Should be at RAG Collections |
| 1:30 | Should be at Analytics dashboard |
| 2:00 | Should be at closing sequence |

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Cursor moving too fast
- ❌ Not pausing on important UI elements
- ❌ Typing too quickly (hard to follow)
- ❌ Forgetting to show Live Status window updates
- ❌ Not demonstrating @TAG syntax
- ❌ Skipping profile color/icon indicators
- ❌ Recording entire screen instead of browser window
- ❌ Having errors/warnings visible in UI

---

## 📞 Emergency Troubleshooting

**If QuickTime crashes:**
- Restart and try Kap instead: `brew install --cask kap`

**If recording is choppy:**
- Lower frame rate to 10 fps
- Close all other applications
- Disable browser extensions

**If GIF is too large (>25MB):**
```bash
# Reduce colors
gifsicle -O3 --lossy=100 --colors 128 input.gif -o output.gif

# Or reduce frame rate
ffmpeg -i input.gif -vf "fps=10" output.gif
```

**If scenes are out of order:**
- Can record separately and concatenate:
```bash
ffmpeg -i scene1.mov -i scene2.mov \
  -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]concat=n=2:v=1[outv]" \
  -map "[outv]" combined.mov
```
